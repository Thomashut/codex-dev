  Description   :
    User landing page when they first connect to the site. Gives general site
    news too. Later a in site news form might be added but currently the only
    way to create new news posts is to do it manually via the database

  <p> This is the public test of the new Syntax and Semantic Learning Platform Codex</p>
  <p> Codex hopes to be a new tool available to developers to help them to learn new programming languages and to also help improve their knowledge of languages they may already develop in. </p>

  <p> The tool itself places an increase focus on learning the semantics and syntax of a programming language over just learning the solution to a specific problem. The attributes attached to every post are an example of this. </p>
  <br/>

  <p> <b><i> !Notice! </i></b> this is a test to determine the effectiveness of the site's features. It would be greatly appreciated if you could fill out the following survey with a focus on the
    <b> functionality </b> of the site rather than it's usability.
    <br/> This site is a prototype of what is to follow, so development has been focused on it's features over it's usability. That means that any bugs in the interface or generally poor user experiences should be ignored if possible. There is a section
    within the survey to report any such bugs, but it would be appreciated if you could try all the features and give your opinion on the features themseleves and how they perform.

    <p> This is the public test of the new Syntax and Semantic Learning Platform Codex</p>
    <p> Codex hopes to be a new tool available to developers to help them to learn new programming languages
        and to also help improve their knowledge of lanauges they may already develop in. </p>

    <p> <i> !Notice! </i> this is a test to determine the effectiveness of the site's features.
        It would be greatly appreciated if you could fill out the following survey with a focus on the
        <b> functionality </b> of the site rather than it's usability. This site is a prototype of what is
        to follow so development has been focused on it's features over it's usability. That means that any
        bugs in the interface or generally poor user experiences should be ignored if possible. There is a
        section within the survey to report any such bugs but it would be appreciated if you could try all the
        features and give your opinion on the features themseleves and how they perform.
